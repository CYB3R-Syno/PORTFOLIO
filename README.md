This is a portfolio site that I created. 

The sauce can be used publicly, and when using it, make by should be left on the bottom.

Production Period : 3ë‹¬

It was produced in node.js and hosted through heroku.

The files on github will be updated continuously, and anyone can use them as an open source.

However, we would appreciate it if you could leave the bottom "website design with by X3eRo0" as is.


Heroku Hosting Method
1. heroku login
2. heroku git:clone -a filename
3. cd filename
4. git add .
5. git commit -am "make it better"
6. git push heroku master
